# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an unbeatable AI opponent using the **Minimax algorithm**. The game allows you to play against the computer or watch two AIs play against each other.

## 🚀 Features
- **Unbeatable AI**: The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to always make the best possible move.
- **Two modes**:
  - Play against the AI.
  - AI vs. AI to watch perfect gameplay.
- **Simple and intuitive interface** using `pygame`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the game logic.
- **Pygame**: Used for the graphical interface.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Ensures the AI makes optimal decisions.

## 📦 Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
    cd tic-tac-toe-ai
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Make sure you have `pygame` installed. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python runner.py
    ```

## 🎮 How to Play
- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on the grid.
- The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- You can play as **X** or **O**, and the AI will take the other side.

## 🧠 Minimax Algorithm
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, which evaluates all possible moves and selects the one that maximizes its chance of winning while minimizing the opponent's.
